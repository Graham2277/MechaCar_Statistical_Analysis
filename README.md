- Based on the linear regression ran above, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and the AWD provided a non-random amount of variance while the the vehicle length and groud clearence were significant.

- The slope is not equal to zero since the p-value is below 0.05
- The model shoudld be roughly 71.49% accurate with it's predictions.

- Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the manufacturer's design specifications of less than 100 lbs of variance, however Lot 3 has roughly 170 lbs of variance so it does not meet the design specs
